# 🤖 AI Resume Assistant (RAG Architecture)

> A Python-based microservice that allows recruiters and visitors to "chat" with a professional profile using Natural Language Processing.

## 📖 Overview
This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application designed to modernize personal portfolios. Instead of reading a static static CV, users can ask specific questions (e.g., *"What is Benjamin's experience with Cybersecurity?"*) and receive accurate, context-aware answers generated by an LLM.

It is built to demonstrate **FastAPI** development, **LangChain** integration, and **System Prompt Engineering**.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Context-Aware Responses:** The AI is fed a structured context of professional experience, ensuring answers are strictly based on facts.
* **Graceful Fallbacks:** If a question falls outside the scope of the resume, the bot politely informs the user rather than hallucinating answers.
* **FastAPI Backend:** Lightweight, asynchronous API designed for high performance and easy deployment (Render/Railway).
* **CORS Enabled:** Ready for integration with any frontend (WordPress, React, etc.).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.9+
* **Framework:** FastAPI
* **AI/LLM:** LangChain & OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini)
* **Validation:** Pydantic
